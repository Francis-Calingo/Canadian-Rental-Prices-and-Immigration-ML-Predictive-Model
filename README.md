# GROUP PROJECT OVERVIEW: Machine Learning Predictive Model, Canadian Immigration and Rental Prices

  <ul>
    <li>Predict Rental Prices across 6 major Canadian cities in 2025 given permanent resident data and rental price data.</li>
    <li>Scraped Permanent Resident Admissions data (since 2015) from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.</li>
    <li>Generated synthetic rental price data using a comprehensive ChatGPT prompt to compensate for lack of propietary data.</li>
    <li>Performed Hyperparamter Tuning on Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models using GridSearchCV to reach the best models.</li>
  </ul>
  
## Code and Resources Used
  <ul>
    <li>IDEs Used: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook</li>
    <li>Python Version: 3.10.12</li>
    <li>Libraries and Packages: [google.colab] files, [pandas] pandas, [seaborn] seaborn, sklearn[ColumnTransformer, Pipeline, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, train_test_split, LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, r2_score, RandomForestRegressor, make_scorer, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV] </li>
    <li>ChatGPT version: GPT-4</li>
  </ul>
  
## Web Scraping
Permanent Residence admission Data was scraped from this website: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/f7e5498e-0ad8-4417-85c9-9b8aff9b9eda/resource/81021dfd-c110-42cf-a975-1b9be8b82980 

## Feature Engineering
The following ChatGPT prompt was used to generate our synthetic data:
